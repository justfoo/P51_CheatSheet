# P-51 CHEATSHEET

A *cheatsheet* intended to be used for the DCS P-51D module. This was inspired by (and forked from) the outstanding [F-14 CheatSheet](https://github.com/Techneatium/F14_CheatSheet) by [Techneatium](https://github.com/Techneatium).

The information contained herein currently tracks closely to **AAF MANUAL 51-127-5 Pilot Training Manual for the P-51 Mustang (15 Aug 1945)**, but is likely to be heavily reorganized as this project progresses. Portions may be removed, added, or moved around for three main reasons:
  * The AAF manual was designed for training in the real-world aircraft in the 1940's. It may refer to practices, or systems that are not modelled in DCS, and hence have little utility for virtual pilots.
  * While much of the content contains specific procedures and checklists, much of it is simply descriptive or explanatory. The purpose of this project is not to reproduce the manual in a different format, but to extract as a quick reference the salient information to serve as a memory aid for in-simulator operations.
  * The information classification and architecture in the manual is kind of a mess. I'm going to try to develop a better taxonomy of information and group things in a more intuitive way, likely based around the general information organization found in modern training manuals and pilot operating handbooks.

## Work-in-progress

This is nowhere near complete yet, and should be considered a pre-alpha work-in progress.
